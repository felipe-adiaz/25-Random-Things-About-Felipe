        <h3>Visiting Ambler Stadium</h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/felipe-adiaz/25-Random-Things-About-Felipe/raw/main/Tennis-Courts-Ambler-Stadium.JPEG" alt="mile 1" class="pic1">
        <p> My inner child was absolutely thrilled to visit those courts. Duke was a dream school for me as a junior player hoping to play college tennis in the U.S., 
          partly because it was home to Brazilian junior players Bruno Semenzato and Henrique Cunha, who was ranked among the top 5 junior players in the world at the time. 
          Cunha made history playing for Duke in the NCAA, winning the All-America title three times.

        <p> As a huge Coach K fan, attending a basketball game was an unforgettable experience. My namesake and new Brazilian friend, Luis Felipe '26, had a spare ticket for me. 
          I spent an amazing evening with new friends—Pedro '19, Lais '26, Fabi, and Camilla '26—appearing on the stadium screen, 
          enjoying dinner, and hitting Tavern Tuesday later. Can’t wait to camp out for season tickets!</p>

        <p> This was published in a local journal prior to my trip to Tandil: "Young tennis players from Brasília aim to improve by following the example of Argentine players on the global circuit." 
          We had the opportunity to practice with former coaches of some of the best Argentine professionals of all time, including Juan Martín del Potro, former US Open champion; 
          Juan Mónaco, a former top 10 player in the world; and Mariano Zabaleta, a former top 20 player. 
          We spent a couple of weeks practicing at the same club where they trained as kids, hosted by Cristina at her pension, who cooked the best meals. </p>

        <p>Even though I had to stop competing around the age of 15, after a few years break, I was able to play again, as much as my body allowed. 
          I could compete a little and even play for the Derby University team while living in England. 
          Tennis has always been a part of my life, and to this day, I play whenever I can, though sometimes my body charges me a high price if I push it too hard.</p>

        <p> I started playing the guitar when I was 8 years old. I used to visit my grandmother and play with all of my uncle's instruments from a very young age. 
          By the time I started playing songs on my little sister's keyboard, my parents figured it was time to give me my first guitar. 
          Blues is definitely one of the genres that most represents my musical inclinations, especially when playing the guitar.</p>

        <h3>Chorinho: Brazil’s Melodic Treasure</h3>

        </iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
        <p>In this video, I’m playing the cavaquinho, a traditional instrument in both samba and choro. 
          Choro, which translates to "cry," is a melodic and musically sophisticated style of instrumental music traditional to Brazil. 
          Renowned for its richness and technical demands, it is often associated with highly skilled, virtuosic musicians.
          The piece featured here is called "Carioquinha", a diminutive form of "Carioca," which refers to someone from Rio de Janeiro. 
          The suffix "-inha" adds an affectionate tone in Portuguese, giving the name an endearing touch.</p>

    <p>These are pictures from my time in England. The first is from a local newspaper article about Brazilians cheering for their home team during the 2014 World Cup. 
      The second captures a gathering where Brazilian and international friends came together to watch Brazil’s opening match. 
      Even the university admissions team joined us for this big celebration.
      The third picture is from our "Festa Junina," a traditional Brazilian celebration held every June. 
      The attire reflects Brazil’s rural heritage: women often wear colorful dresses with patchwork patterns, while men typically sport plaid shirts, jeans, straw hats, and painted mustaches. 
      This vibrant and playful style honors the country’s countryside culture and adds to the joyful atmosphere of the event.</p>

      <p> This was one of the most fascinating trips of my life. Along with my exchange student friends, I traveled through Portugal and Spain before flying from Seville to Morocco. 
        From there, we journeyed deep into the desert to spend a night at a Bedouin camp. 
        We enjoyed traditional food, listened to local music, admired the breathtaking night sky and sunrise, and immersed ourselves in the richness of the local culture. 
        It was truly an unforgettable experience.</p>

        <p>In 2022, I attended Expo Dubai on a business trip with the board and directors of Elephant Skin. 
          This trip was a powerful bonding experience that took place just before our strategic planning sessions. 
          Building a cohesive shared vision requires deeper connections, and this trip provided the perfect opportunity for that. 
          We strengthened our team dynamic while exploring the Expo and established valuable relationships with Middle Eastern real estate developers. 
          It was truly unforgettable, not only because of the incredible diversity of nationalities I encountered but also due to the fascinating cultural differences I experienced throughout the journey.</p>

          I initially gathered some local musicians to play at a friend’s house, and after a few events, we started getting invited to perform at shows. 
          It turned into a wonderful opportunity to enjoy my hobby while supporting the talented friends I made through music—all of whom are professional local musicians.</p>

        <h3>From Pizza Night to Fintech: Bankswapp</h3>
        <div style="padding:54.17% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1040092271?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"

        <p>After organizing a pizza night for my close group of friends, I noticed that everyone was trying to avoid paying banking fees. 
          This observation made me realize that if my friends were worried about this, countless others likely faced the same challenge. 
          I soon discovered that millions of Brazilians didn’t even have access to banking services.
          This sparked an idea: by opening accounts with all the major banks and creating a digital platform, I could simplify the process and offer digital wallets. 
          That’s how "Bankswapp" was born—a project that even became a registered company. However, at the time, I lacked the leadership experience and network needed to sustain and grow the idea. 
          Upon graduation, I decided to gain practical experience by working at a startup instead..</p>

        <h3>My Favorite Nietzsche books</h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/felipe-adiaz/25-Random-Things-About-Felipe/raw/main/Favorite-Book.JPEG" alt="mile 1" class="pic7">
        <p>“Become who you are!” (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part III, “On the Spirit of Gravity”).
           Nietzsche’s philosophy resonates with me because of his radical break from the notion of a predefined essence or purpose. 
           He challenges the classical views of thinkers like Socrates and Plato, particularly their emphasis on a metaphysical cosmic order or ideal destiny, which prioritizes abstract truths over the reality of lived experience.
           For Nietzsche, life is not about conforming to an external purpose but about embracing the freedom to create one’s own meaning and values. 
           What I find most intriguing is how provocative and transformative his ideas are. 
          He offered a unique perspective on nihilism, viewing it not as a lack of values, as it is commonly understood, 
          but as turning away from the richness of real life in favor of abstract ideals or transcendent notions beyond the reality we live in. 
          His reflections challenge us to embrace life as it is, in its raw and unfiltered form, and that kind of perspective deeply inspires and provokes me.</p>

        <img src="https://github.com/felipe-adiaz/25-Random-Things-About-Felipe/raw/main/Teal Group.JPEG" alt="mile 1" class="pic8">
        <p>This was an unforgettable experience that still resonates within the company to this day, as they often remind me. 
          I was entrusted with planning the strategic planning event for my former consulting firm. 
          I named the event "Going Teal," inspired by the book Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux, which had been translated into Portuguese by one of the firm's partners.
          In the context of the book, "teal" refers to a forward-thinking organizational model that emphasizes self-management, a sense of purpose, and wholeness. 
          It challenges traditional hierarchical structures, promoting collaboration, autonomy, and a deeper connection to the organization’s mission.</p>

        <h3>Tim Cook: A True Leader of Consequence</h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/felipe-adiaz/25-Random-Things-About-Felipe/raw/main/Nomination.PNG" alt="mile 1" class="pic9">
        <p>Reading Steve Jobs’ biography was truly inspiring for me.
           I was in awe of how he thought outside the ordinary, lived an unconventional life, held strong beliefs, and could see possibilities that others couldn’t. 
           One example that stood out to me was his involvement in typography classes, which ultimately influenced the Mac’s iconic design. 
           To this day, Macs remain the go-to platform for designers and creatives. 
           There is so much to learn from his visionary approach. What made it even more meaningful was Tim Cook’s presence in various parts of the book. 
           Jobs’ public letter recommending Tim Cook as his successor, combined with knowing that Cook is an MBA graduate from Fuqua, is incredibly inspiring to me. 
           It connects two remarkable leaders and reinforces my own aspirations.</p>
